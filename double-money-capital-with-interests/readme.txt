What does this program do?
- It asks for two variable's (capital and interests)
- after it'll create a pointer object from the class Kapital_rechner
- the variables capital and interests are being picked up by the constructor, which is basically running the math operation including output
- after the object has been created the program will check depending on the user's input wether to exit or to redo the loop
- if the user decides to redo the process, the programm will delete the object from the heap and the whole process starts from scratch
